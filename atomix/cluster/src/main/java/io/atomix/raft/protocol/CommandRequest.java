/**
 * Client command request.
 *
 * <p>Command requests are submitted by clients to the Raft cluster to commit commands to the
 * replicated state machine. Each command request must be associated with a registered {@link
 * #session()} and have a unique {@link #sequenceNumber()} number within that session. Commands will
 * be applied in the cluster in the order defined by the provided sequence number. Thus, sequence
 * numbers should never be skipped. In the event of a failure of a command request, the request
 * should be resent with the same sequence number. Commands are guaranteed to be applied in sequence
 * order.
 *
 * <p>Command requests should always be submitted to the server to which the client is connected and
 * will be forwarded to the current cluster leader. In the event that no leader is available, the
 * request will fail and should be resubmitted by the client.
